# ArrayDeque
This is a project that I created for my Data Structures class at UC Berkeley.  The ArrayDeque is a list, and the LinkedListDeque is a linked list.  
Both implement the Deque interface.  Both support constant time insertions to the front and back of the data structure, and the ArrayDeque supports 
constant time access to elements in the array.
